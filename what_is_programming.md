# What is programming?

Programming is a way of telling computers what to do, and revolves around data and ways of manipulating it. When you're working with data, they're put in temporary containers called "variables" and "objects".  We'll be showing you how to create variables with your data, modify it, and display it for your games.  We'll be coding in a language called Python today, and if you don't know it yet, most of you are bilingual, so I'm sure learning a third language will be pretty natural for you.
