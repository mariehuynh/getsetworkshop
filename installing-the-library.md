# Installing the library

You should be in the Bash console ($).


If you see the Python prompt (>>>), you need to quit out of that to get back to the console!
```
>>> quit()
```

Installation is simple.  pythonanywhere.com does not give you permission to install libraries for the whole system, but you can install it to your own account.  

```
$ pip install wordcloud -t .
```

This command will create a directory named wordcloud and install the library exactly where you run it.  Make sure you don't forget the . at the end.
