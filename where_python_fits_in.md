# Where Python Fits in

Computers are actually pretty dumb and at the heart of it all, are just fancy calculators.  They don't really know anything.  All the "smarts" of these machines are programs written by people and they've just been faking intelligence this whole time.

Programming calculators is kind of boring, and that's kind of what Assembly was like; all you had was multiply, add, jump to this other instruction, add some more things.  They were tiny tools to do tiny operations.  Building a real house with tiny tools isnâ€™t going to be fun.  But you can use tiny tools to build bigger, better tools.

So as soon as hardware was good enough, higher level languages were designed on top of them that could be translated.  With higher level languages, you can essentially say more in fewer words, and Python is one of these high level, interpreted languages, and you can tell it to print something on the screen and draw pretty images without doing math.

To be clear, low level languages are still useful for when you want very fine grained control over what the computer is doing, the detail work.  But this is often not necessary.
