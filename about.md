"You just covered more in three hours than some people do in a year."

This book is not meant to be a comprehensive manual to Python, but rather a crash course that introduces teenagers to many of the important concepts.  It is based on workshops I developed for the Society of Women Engineers's GetSET(Science, Engineering & Technology) program. This award-winning outreach program is dedicated to encouraging, motivating and exposing young ladies from underrepresented groups to STEM careers.  

Each major section was presented in one 6-hour workshop to students who had just finished 9th grade and had zero programming experience.  All the students completed all the exercises, and by the end of the day, all of them left having had a taste of using real tools, including:
* running commands in bash
* installing libraries using pip -t
* writing basic python (including typecasting, functions, loops, random, etc.)
* using both normal and interactive modes of Python
* reading documentation for optional parameters to change library behavior
* reading and modifying example code provided by libraries on github


Of course, the devil's in the details, and you can't cover everything in 6 hours, but they don't need to know every single type available to understand typecasting well enough to use it.  They don't need to know every type of control structure available to be able to start using a few to write games.  Remember that people did amazing things with just assembly.  If they are interested in continuing to develop programming skills, those details will come in time, and should be trivial to grasp after the first few.

As a woman in engineering, it is frustrating to see intro materials for young girls decked out in pink with dolls.  Toys superficially touching on logic with no deep challenges or attempts to teach real tools that they will be able to use beyond the little games does them a great disservice when boys their age are taken to hackathons.  Dolls did not make me an engineer.  A love for creating did.  Dolls of engineers would not have made a difference to me.

This my attempt to create something that I would have wanted as a child, as someone who craved more but did not have access. I dedicate this book to 

It is never too late to give yourself the childhood you want.
