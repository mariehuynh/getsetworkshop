"You just covered more in three hours than some people do in a year."

This is based on a workshop I developed for the Society of Women Engineers's GetSET(Science, Engineering & Technology) program. This award-winning outreach program is dedicated to encouraging, motivating and exposing young ladies from underrepresented groups to STEM careers.  

Each major section was presented in one 6-hour workshop to students who had just finished 9th grade, and had zero programming experience.  All the students completed all the exercises, and by the end of the day, all of them left having a taste of using real tools, including:
* bash
* installing libraries using pip -t
* writing basic python (including typecasting, functions, loops, random, etc.)
* reading documentation
* using optional parameters to change library behavior

They did it all in straight python.

Proof yet again that you can teach a bunch of teenage girls(just finished freshman year of high school) to code. They don't need shitty pink blocks or fake languages. You don't need to dumb it down. They get it. I am so proud of them. Even if they don't decide to go into CS, they are completely capable of doing it.


This book is not meant to be a comprehensive manual to Python, but rather a crash course that introduces teenagers to many of the important concepts.  Of course, the devil's in the details, but they don't need to know every single type available to understand typecasting.  They don't need to know every type of loop available to be able to start using them to write games.  

As a woman in engineering, it is frustrating to see intro materials for young girls decked out in pink with dolls.  Toys superficially touching on logic with no deep challenges or attempts to teach real tools that they will be able to use beyond the little games does them a great disservice when boys their age are taken to hackathons.  Dolls did not make me an engineer.  A love for creating did.  

This my attempt to create something that I would have wanted as a child, as someone who craved more but did not have access. I dedicate this book to 

It is never too late to give yourself the childhood you want.
