# Some history
Computers were originally designed to compute. That is, they're actually fancy calculators at heart. The screens have gotten fancier and the hardware fancier, but everything that you see it do is represented by numbers and generated with calculations.  

Rear Admiral Grace M. Hopper invented the first compiler for a computer programming language. Compilers translate programming languages, which are easier for humans to read, into a binary form that can be run as a program by computers.
