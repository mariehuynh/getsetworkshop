#Text Editors

There are many text editors available and good ones allow you to work quickly and effectively.  There's quite a spectrum in complexity, from basic editing to more sophisticated beasts with their own package management systems, which make it quick and easy to install plugins to customize your experience.  You should try a variety and see which style you like.


#### vi vs emacs
Some traditionalists prefer to work in vi or emacs, and they and their variants are still widely used.  Both were first developed in the mid 70's, at a time when resources were scarce and GUIs weren't an option.  Despite their limitations, they were effective and still hold the records for being the longest-lived programs of all time.  They and their variants are actively maintained, developed, and used.  

The topic of which is better has sparked endless arguments over the years (see [Editor war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war)), though it doesn't seem quite as intense as it once was.  Neither look like they are going away anytime soon, but with the rise of modern editors with GUIs, it's no longer strictly necessary to learn to use them.  



Nowadays, the war between those two has died down a bit with the rise of modern editors.  In an attempt to lure in some traditionalists, Sublime offers a "vintage mode" for people who prefer to keep using the same shortcuts that have long become muscle memory.  Or perhaps someone found it easier to write a plugin than retrain their grey matter.  Either way, these options exist.
