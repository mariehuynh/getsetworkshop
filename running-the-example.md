#Running the Example
When your code is saved as a file with the .py extension, the system will treat it as a python script.  

#### Nerd level 0
Click on the name of the file masked.py.  You should see a blue button with >>>.  Click on that to run it.

#### Nerd level 1
You can run scripts via the command line.  Make sure you are in Bash and have the $ prompt.
```
python masked.py
```

This will run the code.  When it is done, it will give you the prompt back.
