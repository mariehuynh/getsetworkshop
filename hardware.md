# Hardware

How many of you have taken a computer class?


Before we get to the coding, let’s talk about what the parts of the computer are.  Obviously, there’s a monitor in front of you,
but what are the other parts?  What’s in the box hooked up to it?

Some key components

- CPU - Central Processing Unit

    - does the basic math, logic, control, input/output operations
- Hard Drive

    - where your data is stored
- RAM - Random Access Memory

    - temporarily holds data that you’re using so you can get to it faster

If you think about your brain as a computer, things that you learn get stored on the "hard drive” but it may take you a while to remember things you learned a few years ago if you haven’t used it recently.  Things you have thought about recently get stored in RAM.  Generally, the more RAM a machine has, the faster it is.

Computers used to be massive things that took up whole rooms, but nowadays, they're so small that your phone is basically a mini computer.  It has a mini versions of everything these computers have, including mini versions of the software.
