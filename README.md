# Welcome to the Intro Python workshop!

SWE GetSET Python Workshops

This assumes students have a basic understanding of how to use a computer.  Whether or not you are interested in pursuing a career in software engineering, I hope this helps you understand some of the basic concepts in programming.

### Why this matters

Most of my friends in STEM \(and some in Humanities\) ended up needing to write some code at some point in their careers.  Programming is a very useful skill that can save\(or create\) a lot of time and money for you.  It allows you to gain access to and sift through mountains of information and show you patterns that may be difficult to see otherwise.
