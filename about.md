"You just covered more in three hours than some people do in a year."

This is based on a workshop I developed for the Society of Women Engineers's GetSET(Science, Engineering & Technology) program. This award-winning outreach program is dedicated to encouraging, motivating and exposing young ladies from underrepresented groups to STEM careers.  

Each major section was presented in one 6-hour workshop to students who had just finished 9th grade, and has zero programming experience.  All the students completed all the exercises.  By the end of the day, all of them left having done pip install -t, written basic python (including typecasting, functions, loops, random, etc.), combined it all for a guessing game, and then generated images with a library while tweaking some parameters for scale, color, font size, etc., all in straight python.

Proof yet again that you can teach a bunch of teenage girls(just finished freshman year of high school) to code. They don't need shitty pink blocks or fake languages. You don't need to dumb it down. They get it. I am so proud of them. Even if they don't decide to go into CS, they are completely capable of doing it.


This book is not meant to be a comprehensive manual to Python, but rather a crash course that introduces teenagers to many of the important concepts.  Of course, the devil's in the details, but they don't need to know every single type available to understand typecasting.  They don't need to know every type of loop available to be able to start using them to write games.  

As a woman in engineering, it is frustrating to see intro materials for girls decked out in pink with dolls and/or superficially touching on logic with no deep challenges or attempts to teach real tools that they will be able to use beyond the little games.
