# Text Editors

There are many text editors available and good ones allow you to work quickly and effectively.  There's quite a spectrum in complexity, from basic editing to more sophisticated beasts with their own package management systems, which make it quick and easy to install plugins to customize your experience.  You should try a variety and see which style you like.

#### vi vs emacs

Some traditionalists prefer to work in vi or emacs, and they and their variants are still widely used.  Both were first developed in the mid 70's, at a time when resources were scarce and GUIs weren't an option.  Despite their limitations, they were effective and still hold the records for being the longest-lived programs of all time.  They and their variants are actively maintained, developed, and used.

The topic of which is better has sparked endless arguments over the years \(see [Editor war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war)\), though it doesn't seem quite as intense now as it once was.  Neither look like they are going away anytime soon, but with the rise of modern editors with GUIs, it's no longer strictly necessary to learn to use them to get things done.  Still, should you ever find yourself on an old system or a newer but malfunctioning one, you may find them handy.  You may also bag a few bonus points in an interview with them.

Nowadays, the war between those two has died down a bit with the rise of modern editors. In an attempt to lure in some traditionalists, Sublime offers a "vintage mode" for people who prefer to keep using the same shortcuts that have long become muscle memory. Or perhaps someone found it easier to write a plugin than retrain their grey matter. Either way, these options exist.

#### Modern editors

Editors have come a long way since the 70's, adding all sorts of new features along the way.  Some, like Sublime Text, have their own built-in package management system for all the plugins and customizations people have contributed.  



#### Integrated Development Environments
Some people love them.  Some hate them.  Some merely tolerate them because it's required by their workplace.


#### What I use
As of this writing, I currently use Sublime for most of my development, but I still use vi occasionally.  If I need to make a minor edit to a file while on the command line, it's faster to use vi than start up Sublime and deal with the GUI if it's not already open.  My hands never have to leave the keyboard while I work.  

Is this worth the overhead of learning to use vi?  That's up to you.  All shortcuts take some time to memorize.  Old tools aren't exactly user friendly.  You can get quite far as a software developer without deeply understanding how to use the command line, but even if you don't spend much time using the command line, it is a skill that sets you apart as being more capable than others who only know how to work the GUIs.  I recommend investing an afternoon in playing with vi/emacs to see what they are capable of, just for the experience.
